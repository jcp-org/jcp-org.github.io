# Preparing Your GitHub Account


* If you already have a GitHub account, you can use that - you don't have to create a new account just for the JCP GitHub organization.
  If you don't have a GitHub account, [create an individual one with the Free plan](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). You can use your personal email. 

* However, if you are an Oracle employee your GitHub account must be associated with your @oracle.com email address even if you've created your account with a personal email address.
    * To do so, make sure you add your @oracle.com email address to your account

* Your profile must be properly configured with at least the following:
    * Your Full Name
    * A custom profile picture (this doesn't have to be your actual photo; anything custom works just fine).

* Once you have a GitHub account and it's configured, send an email to pmo@jcp.org with the following subject:
    * [New Contributor] @your-github-username

* After that, you will be sent an e-mail invitation from the JCP GitHub Organization
    * Accept the invitation
    * [Publicize your membership as instructed](https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership/)
    * Notify pmo@jcp.org that you've completed the work
